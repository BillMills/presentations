# Contributing

### Conventions

Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bugfix branch, name it XXX-something where XXX is the number of the
  issue
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce your
  intentions, and name it XXX-something where XXX is the number of the issue.

### Merge approval

Docker maintainers use LGTM (looks good to me) in comments on the code review
to indicate acceptance.

A change requires LGTMs from at least one maintainer.
