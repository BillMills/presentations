                        <li>The docker0 interface is a virtual Ethernet bridge interface</li><br>
                        <li>It passes or switches packets between two connected devices just like a physical bridge or switch</li>

                        <li>Each new container gets one interface that is automatically attached to the docker0 bridge</li>

					<h2>Creating your own network</h2>
                    <li>We can setup our own network for running our containers</li><br>
                    <li>Two types of networks we can create</li>

                    <li>A bridge network is very similar to the docker0 network (the default bridge network weâ€™ve seen)</li><br>
                    <li>An Overlay network can span across multiple hosts</li>

					<h2>Bridge Network</h2>
                    <li>Containers must reside on the same host</li>
                    <li>Containers in user defined bridge network can communicate with each other using their IP address and container name</li>
                    <li>Docker 1.10 ships with an embedded DNS server to resolve container names to IP addresses</li>

					<h2>Docker Compose and networking</h2>
                    <li>Networking is supported in v2 Compose files</li>
                    <li>By default Compose creates a bridge network for your application and runs all the containers defined by the services in your configuration file in that network</li>
                    <li>Network name is the name of the project folder or it can be defined in the Compose file</li>

					<h2>Compose and Swarm</h2>
                    <li>When a Compose application is run against Swarm, it will create an overlay network for the application by default</li>
                    <li>Swarm will schedule the application containers across different nodes</li>
                    <li>Network creation will fail if your nodes are not connected to a key/value store </li>
                    <li>This behaviour was observed in Task 5</li>
