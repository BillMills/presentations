                        <p>Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) is a registry server that you can run securely on your own infrastructure</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>What features does DTR include?</h2>
                        <li>Image registry to store images</li>
                        <li>Pluggable storage drivers</li>
                        <li>Web based GUI for admin configuration</li>
                        <li>Easy and transparent upgrades</li>
                        <li>Built in system usage metrics dashboard</li>
                        <li>Logging</li>
                        <aside class="notes">Speaker Notes: The following features differentiate DTR from Docker Hub, the normal registry server: Web based GUI for admin configuration, Easy and transparent upgrades, Built in system usage metrics dashboard, logging, and built in support for basic and LDAP authentication</aside>

                        <h2>DTR Primary Usage Scenarios</h2><br>
                        <h3 class="accent_text_color">CI/CD with Docker:</h3>
                        <li>Centrally located base images</li>
                        <li>Store individual build images</li>
                        <li>Pull tested images to production</li>
                        <li>Developer workflow is a commit</li>
						<aside class="notes">Speaker Notes:
						The first is CI/CD. Many customers start here. This use case is focused on:
						<li>Stored base images that can be reused as a base layer</li>
						<li>Stored layers from which you can start a build</li>
						<li>Stored images after they are built and tested in CI</li>
						<li>A library of images that can be deployed by production</li>
						<li>Developers don’t know they are using docker (they just commit code through GH or SCCM of choice).</li>
						</aside>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3 class="accent_text_color">Containers-as-a-Service:</h3>
                        <li>With Docker UCP</li>
                        <li>Deploy Jenkins executors or Hadoop nodes</li>
                        <li>Instant-on developer environment</li>
                        <li>Select curated apps from a catalog</li>
                        <aside class="notes">Speaker Notes:
						The second use case is to deliver containers as a service. Think of this as a curated application catalog (like App Store) that teams can set up and allow individuals to deploy a ready-to-use container. Examples include jenkins executors and hadoop nodes. This is a classic use case for Docker Hub today and our intention is to make the two products look identical from a functional standpoint.
