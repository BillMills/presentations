                    <aside class="notes">Speaker notes: Build: Enable developers to build Dockerized distributed apps.  Docker Toolbox is an installer for Mac and PC to set up a local development environment.  Applications built locally can be deployed and run in production without changes to the code.  Developers define the application behavior and needs from the infrastructure.  SHIP: secure content and collaboration between dev and IT ops.  Create and manage a library of base images in the cloud or on-premise (VPC).  Secure content with digital signatures and content integrity with image scanning.  Control access and permissions by user or organizations.  Web UI to search and browse repos, manage users and settings.  Integrate to CI and CD systems to automate workflows.  RUN: Deploy and manage Dockerized distributed apps anywhere.  Management console in the cloud or on-premise.  Manage across hybrid infrastructure.  GUI.  Deploy and manage containers and Compose apps.  Deploy and manage clusters of Engines (Swarm)  Integrated management of images, network, and volumes.  Registry integration to Hub or Trusted Registry.  System metrics like monitoring, logs, and service history.</aside>
