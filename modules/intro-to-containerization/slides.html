    <p>"Starting and Inspecting a Container"</p>

    <aside class="notes">
    	- Let's start by firing up a container right away, and exploring a few details of exactly what's going on when we start a container.

    <h2>Container Isolation</h2>

    <ul style='float:right; max-width: 47%;'>
        <li>Containers are formed by namespacing resources from the host machine - PID tree, kernel, network etc</li>
        <li>Command specified by `docker run` is always PID 1 inside the container; will have a higher PID on the host machine but is <i>part of the same PID tree</i></li>
        <li>Container only runs as long as the process specified in `docker run`.</li>
        <li>`containerd` is in charge of starting, stopping and destroying containers; built on top of runc (https://runc.io) and `libcontainer`.</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
         - besides the basic syntax for starting a container, the first example illustrated the contrast between the pid tree inside and outside of the container. Unlike VMs, Docker containers don't create a whole new virtual operating system; they essentially partition the kernel of the host using kernel and network namespaces, among other core linux features.<br>

        - Now that we've run a single process in a container, let's explore interacting with running containers.
