        - back in the day, shipping cargo was a big problem - here are some 19th century devops struggling to deploy their latest product.
        - huge delays, breakage and theft were caused by the fact that loose cargo had to be packed and unpacked at ports for redistribution

    <aside class="notes">
    	- the great innovation of shipping containerization was the repacking was no longer necessary, allowing cargo to move from ship to train to truck with far less friction.
    	- shipping wasn't the only example, either; standardization of replacable parts was a key methodological innovation that allowed the industrial revolution to scale so dramatically. The history of technology and business is rife with the same pattern...

	<p>The most basic thing Docker provides is a</p>
	<h2>framework for service encapsulation</h2>
    <p>But what are the implications of this for <b>developers</b>, <b>ops</b>, and <b>orgs</b>?</p>
    <aside class="notes">
    	- ...and Docker proposes to implement that pattern of encapsulation and standardization for the software development community, by packaging services with their minimal dependencies in a way that can be run anywhere: ship, train or truck, or aws, azure or on prem as the case may be, without collision between their contents or dependencies.
    	- All of which sounds nice - but what are the practical implications of this brave new modularized world? Given this technology, what would you actually do with it? What are the opportunities and challenges it presents? 
    	- *lead the class in an open discussion for 10-15min on opportunities and challenges of service encapsulation. Highlight opportunities for monolith densification; microservice architecture; and removal of friction between ops and dev. Highlight challenges of process and node brokerage; orchestration; and management issues (security, registry, RBAC...)*
    	- *mention roll on / roll off shipping coming between break bulk and full containerization to lead them to monolith densification if necessary.* 
    	- *discuss Conway's law if necessary, to lead students to how dev and ops can work more effectively together, particularly in a service-oriented org.*

	<p>Encapsulation supercharges:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Monolith Densification</li>
		<li>Service-Based Architecture</li>
		<li>Devops</li>
	</ul>
	<p>But all three of these things are served by an added layer of abstraction that simplifies the coordination of encapsulated services. <i>Distributed Application Architecture</i> is that abstraction.</p>
	
    <aside class="notes">
    	- In all these cases we've talked about, there's a common theme: encapsulation and standardization make it easy to spin up lots of these processes in lots of different contexts, by design - but this gets us into situations where we need to coordinate between all these processes at once, possibly in varying numbers, and possibly across varying numbers of machines. 
    	- So, we want not only to encapsulate our processes, but abstract away the concept of individual processes while developing, and individual nodes while deploying.

	<p>Dockerized Distributed Application Architecture will help you develop for</p>
	<h2>Services, not processes</h2>
	<p>and deploy on</p>
    <h2>Networks, not nodes.</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
        - The mental model that provides this abstraction is called distributed application architecture, and Docker provides the tools to make this paradigm simple to develop and deploy for.
    	- the first half of the docker way of doing things, is to federate encapsulated processes into a single service, and similary federate many nodes into a single swarm, and make these services and swarms the first-class conceptual objects with which you will interact.

	<p>Docker helps create a</p>
	<h2>virtuous circle between dev and ops</h2>
	<p>via service-oriented registry, RBAC, and control planes.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
    	- the other half of the docker way of doing things is to use the portability of software containers to bring dev and ops closer together.
    	- in practise, if we're going to be moving so seamlessly between dev and ops, we need the right enterprise tooling to coordinate all these transactions, between containers but especially between humans.

    	- All this business about encapsulation and standardization is what Docker does better than anyone else out there; we call this 'containerization'.
    	- As we also saw so far, containerization naturally leads to the need to coordinate containers, and even machines; we call this 'orchestration'.
    	- Finally, Docker also empowers developers and ops managers to work more closely together through the lifetime of a service, by removing barriers between dev and ops.
    	- Docker endeavors to provide the tooling to make containerization, orchestration, and frictionless deployment straightforward.
