        - The simplest possible way to imagine application encapsulation is via the encapsulation you get for free - at the hardware level.

        - Physical enapsulation of one application per server is really pretty terrible, because it's inefficient on resources and subject to all the limitations of real-world logistics; provisioning a new server cost as much as a server, and could take weeks while that hardware is sourced, installed in the datacenter and brought online.<br>
        - This also meant that scaling an application couldn't happen in real time.<br>
        - Futhermore, this doesn't provide any facility for moving apps through a pipeline from development to testing to deployment, which by definition must be on separate hardware.<br>

        - Through the early 2000's a number of linux kernel features landed that made lightweight containerization viable.<br>
        - Rather than running a heavyweight guest OS, containers effectively partition the resources of the host OS using namespaces and security features to isolate themselves and create completely independent operating environments without reproducing all the underpinnings and without a hypervisor.<br>
        - All of this results in faster spool-up times for containers and more instances packed onto a given piece of hardware, saving big $ for enterprises vs VMs.

    <aside class="notes">
    	- In all these cases we've talked about, there's a common theme: encapsulation and standardization make it easy to spin up lots of these processes in lots of different contexts, by design - but this gets us into situations where we need to coordinate between all these processes at once, possibly in varying numbers, and possibly across varying numbers of machines.<br>

        - The mental model that provides this abstraction is called distributed application architecture, and Docker provides the tools to make this paradigm simple to develop and deploy for.<br>

        - Finally when it comes time to run these apps in production, Docker Datacenter and all its constituent parts provides the infrastructure necessary for addressing enterprise concerns at scale.<br>
        - Essentially, DDC is Compose and Swarm running under the hood to orchestrate containers across heterogeneous infrastructure, with a bunch of security, trust and management tooling on top.<br>

	<h3>Docker Engine</h3>
    <img style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);' src='images/basic-engine.png'></img>
    <p>One Docker Engine runs on every linux host, using tools like kernel namespacing and control groups to enable the creation of isolated containers.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        - Docker Engine is the funamental runtime that sits on top of linux and manges containers. One engine runs per host.
        - Docker Engine effectively slices up the hosts kernel by partitioning it; pause for a second and comapre this to VMs. There's no hypervisor here, no guest OS and concequently way less resource consumption; and yet we can still isolate our services and their dependencies, but with much less overhead. This is the fundamental magic of Docker.

    <p style='margin-top:200px;'>Docker Machine provisions VMs to act as hosts, as per Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        - Hosts don't need to be bare metal, they can be vms as well
        - Docker Machine provisions VMs to use as Docker hosts; that's what Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows use to stand up a containerizable environment.

    <p>Docker Compose scales services to multiple containers, and orchestrates them together all on a single node; Docker Swarm federates multiple Engines into a single service-management entity.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
    	- Compose and Swarm provide the cross-container and cross-node orchestration we discussed, federating processes into services and nodes into networks.
